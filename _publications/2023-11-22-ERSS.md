The Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan in 2011 substantially undermined global nuclear development, making public acceptance a particularly crucial influential factor worldwide. Although ample studies have identified factors shaping public acceptance, few researchers have paid attention to transitions in public acceptance and perception over the long term, and consistent observations of public acceptance across different periods of the same nuclear power plant (NPP) are particularly lacking. In this study we aim to fill this gap by exploring the transitions in public acceptance of a new NPP during construction phases including before licensing, during licensing, and during construction as well as differences in the influencing factors in each phase. We build up a unique dataset obtained from three rounds of surveys over 7 years in Huizhou City, China. The results reveal that public acceptance rises over time, and that underlying factors vary along with the development of NPPs and public relations campaigns at different phases. Perceived general benefits, government trust, and knowledge of a new local NPP continuously rise with public acceptance, and public perceived health risks continuously decrease over time. As a result, it is key for the government to understand the transition to public acceptance and perceptions of nuclear power and choose different communication strategies according to different phases.
