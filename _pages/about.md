I am an Associate Professor and Director of the Department of Public Policy at the [School of Government](http://www.sg.bnu.edu.cn), Beijing Normal University. I received my Ph.D. in Management from Tsinghua University and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University. My research focuses on behavioural public policy, policy process theory, and the governance of science and technology.

My work has been published in journals such as *Public Administration Review*, *Public Administration*, and *Government Information Quarterly*, as well as leading Chinese journals including *Journal of Chinese Public Administration* (《中国行政管理》) and *Journal of Public Administration* (《公共管理学报》). I currently lead several major research projects, including the Outstanding Young Scholars Innovation Team at Beijing Normal University and grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China. I also serve as the principal investigator for a key project under the National High-end Think Tank Program.

Over the years, I have received several honours, including the Second Prize of the National Teaching Achievement Award (Graduate Level) and the National Award for Outstanding MPA Thesis Supervision. I was also selected for the 8th cohort of the Beijing Young Talent Program for National Governance.

In addition to research and teaching, I actively contribute to academic service. I am a member of the Subcommittee on Public Policy under the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council, a board member of the Public Policy Section of the American Political Science Association, an leading Editor for *Public Administration Review* (《公共管理评论》), and Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the *China Policy Journal*.
