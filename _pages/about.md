I am an Associate Professor and Director of the Department of Public Policy at the [School of Government](http://www.sg.bnu.edu.cn), Beijing Normal University, China. I received my Ph.D. in Public Administration from Tsinghua University and conducted postdoctoral research at Harvard University.

My research addresses a central question: How can policy design influence public acceptance and behavioural responses, especially regarding controversial technologies and complex governance issues? Within this framework, I have investigated how communication strategies and policy feedback shape public acceptance in contexts like nuclear energy and renewable energy siting, analysed the impact of regulatory instruments on acceptance of algorithmic governance and big-data technologies, and explored the behavioural assumptions underpinning effective policy mixes. Methodologically, my work integrates both qualitative and quantitative methods, including experiments, comparative analyses, and case studies, to provide evidence-based causal inferences about effective policy design.

My work has appeared in leading journals such as *Public Administration Review*, *Public Administration*, and *Government Information Quarterly*, as well as top Chinese journals. I currently lead several research projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and serve as the principal investigator of an interdisciplinary innovation team supported by Beijing Normal University.

In addition to research, I serve on the Public Policy Subcommittee of Chinaâ€™s Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council, and I sit on the board of the Public Policy Section of the American Political Science Association. I am also an Advisory Editor for [*China Public Administration Review*](https://gogl.cbpt.cnki.net/portal) and Associate Editors of the [*China Policy Journal*](https://chinapolicyjournal.org).
