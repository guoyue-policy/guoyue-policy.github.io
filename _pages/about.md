I am an Associate Professor and Director of the Department of Public Policy at the [School of Government](http://www.sg.bnu.edu.cn), Beijing Normal University. I received my Ph.D. in Management from Tsinghua University (清华大学) and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University. My research focuses on behavioural public policy, policy process theory, and the governance of science and technology.

My work has been published in journals such as *Public Administration Review*, *Public Administration*, and *Government Information Quarterly*, as well as leading Chinese journals including *Journal of Chinese Public Administration* (《中国行政管理》) and *Journal of Public Administration* (《公共管理学报》). I currently lead several major research projects, including the Outstanding Young Scholars Innovation Team at Beijing Normal University and grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China. I also serve as the principal investigator for a key project under the National High-end Think Tank Program.

Over the years, I have received several honours, including the Second Prize of the National Teaching Achievement Award (Graduate Level) (高等教育国家级教学成果奖二等奖) and the National Award for Outstanding MPA Thesis Supervision (全国公共管理硕士优秀学位论文指导教师奖). I was also selected for the 8th cohort of the Beijing Young Talent Program for National Governance (北京市国家治理青年人才培养计划).

In addition to research and teaching, I actively contribute to academic service. I am a member of the Subcommittee on Public Policy (公共政策二级学科建设工作组) under the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council (国务院学位委员会), a board member of the Public Policy Section of the American Political Science Association, an Advisory Editor for *Public Administration Review*, and Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the *China Policy Journal*.
